# Spectrograph

A simple spectrograph that uses the microphone to display the frequency spectrum of the sound in real time.

Runs full screen and the Windows console is not the fastest to update, so it's not very smooth at larger window sizes.

Try shrinking down to a smaller window size for better performance.

# Known issues

Currently, does not display different values at different frequencies.
